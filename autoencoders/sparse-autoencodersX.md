# Manifold Learning and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoders


Taking inspiration from biological neurons, visual fields of spatial observations contribute to vast significance and information of how we understand the representation of the world relational to ourselves as a singular entity; a process that Convolutional Neural Networks aims to achieve in every entropy transformation. With difficulty of processing high-dimension features like time-series imagining. ~~Dimension reduction~~ Since label classification on images sparse autoencoding of raw data input and , and through compression into a hidden layer neuron as a short code
