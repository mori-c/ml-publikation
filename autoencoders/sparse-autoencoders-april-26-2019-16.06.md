# Manifold Learning and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoders


~~Taking inspiration from biological neurons, visual fields of spatial observations contribute to a vast significance of  information on how we understand the representation of the world, related to ourselves as a singular entity. A process that Convolutional Neural Networks aims to achieve in every entropy transformation. With difficulty of processing high-dimension features like time-series imagining. ~~~~Dimension reduction~~ ~~Since label classification on images sparse autoencoding of raw data input and , and through compression into a hidden layer neuron as a short code~~

This publication is an attempt to explain what deep learning neural net autoencoders are. By defining what they are, how they work, the mathematical algorithms involved and sequential workflows, an introduction to sparsity in autoencoders as a subset parameter feature will provide a
